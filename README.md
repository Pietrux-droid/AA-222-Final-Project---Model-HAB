# AA-222-Final-Project---Model-HAB
Final Project of the AA 222 class in Spring 2025

This project explores the surrogate modeling and Pareto front analysis of two key metrics of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in Western Lake Erie: bloom area extent and the Cyanobacteria Index (CI). Three distinct surrogate modeling approaches are evaluated to derive final surrogate models for both metrics. Using these models in combination with a Latin Hypersquare Sampling approach in the input space, the naive Pareto frontier between the two objectives is mapped. Based on empirical observations of bloom characteristics, the project further incorporates uncertainty quantification via a probabilistic modeling framework.
Over the past two decades, Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) have intensified in severity across Western Lake Erie, prompting the implementation of new phosphorus loading targets for watershed land management. The region has experienced a marked decline in water quality, characterized by both an expansion in the spatial extent of blooms and an increase in cyanobacteria concentrations. The latter is particularly detrimental to the lake's ecosystem, as elevated concentrations of cyanobacteria exacerbate oxygen depletion (hypoxia), thereby disrupting aquatic habitats and significantly impacting fish populations and commercial fisheries
